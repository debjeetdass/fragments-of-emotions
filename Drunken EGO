The greater the ego, the more the hollowness reflects in one's personality.
More self-pride, less substance in reality.
A flawed picture of the greater self is created with forced power.
Even a slight scratch from outside is enough to burst the bubble of ego sitting on a high tower.
The beauty of character gets lost in the smoke of pride.
Politeness and humility get pushed under the carpet while going for an ego ride.
Transparent glass also looks opaque when it is cleaned with a soft brush of vanity.
The layer of distortion an ego creates in one's mind is the epitome of insanity.
As obsession with the ego grows, carrying its weight makes people go crazy.
The deep significance of one's existence also looks vague and hazy.
The beauty of one's accomplishments gets disfigured under the cover of self-praise.
Putting others before oneself doesn't make anyone trivial in any way.
Full sense of self becomes half when the weed of ego grows with speed.
A sense of value gets diminished when one gets trapped by sowing its seed to fulfil their needs.
